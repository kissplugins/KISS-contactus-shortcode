**KISS = Keep It Simple (Stupid)** Plugins are designed to do one thing only. And we believe that one thing should be done very well.

The **KISS Contact Us Shortcode** plugin (BETA) does not have any upsell or freemium features. You get it all.

**You get the folowing:**
Find it under Tools -> Contact Us -> Address and Contact editable area

Then you can embed it almost anywhere on the site include Posts, Pages, and Widgets.
Use the shortcode [contact us] to show that content.

On the content areas, you'll see an "Edit" button at the bottom letting you quickly iterate on it if needed.

**Road Map**

TBD
