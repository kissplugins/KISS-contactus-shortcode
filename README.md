**KISS = Keep It Simple (Stupid)**. KISS Plugins are designed to do one thing only. And we believe that one thing should be done very well.

== Description ==

The **KISS Contact Us Shortcode** plugin provides a simple, customizable shortcode for embedding contact information anywhere on your WordPress site. It's lightweight, free, and does not include any upsells or freemium features—what you see is what you get.

### Key Features:
- **Editable Contact Details**: Use a settings page to manage your company's contact information. Supports hyperlinks and common HTML formatting.
- **Shortcode Support**: Embed your contact details on posts, pages, and widgets using the `[contactus]` shortcode.
- **Quick Editing**: Displays an "Edit" button for admin and editor users, linking directly to the settings page.
- **Widget Compatibility**: Works with both classic and block-based widgets.

This plugin is perfect for users looking for a simple, reliable way to manage and display contact details site-wide.

### Beta Notice:
This software is in **BETA** and still being tested and refined. Use at your own risk. We strongly recommend testing on a staging environment before deploying to a live site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install it directly via the WordPress Plugin Directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to `Tools > Contact Us` to add or edit your contact details.
4. Use the `[contactus]` shortcode to display the contact information on your site.

== How to Use ==

1. Find the plugin under **Tools > Contact Us**. Here, you can edit the contact details using a rich text editor.
2. Use the `[contactus]` shortcode to embed the contact details anywhere on your site—posts, pages, and widget areas.
3. Admins and editors will see an "Edit" link below the displayed content for quick updates.
